    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This tuna noodle casserole is the best with a classic creamy taste from my childhood. 
        The sauce is rich and creamy but not overwhelmingly heavy. 
        The crunch from the topping and fresh bite from the parsley create the perfect balance. 
        Let's not forget that this is a great budget-friendly meal to feed a crowd!
